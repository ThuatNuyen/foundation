# Terrafrom Coding

## Code Structure

---
**NOTE**

The Code Structure will be updated regulary to match the technology and users needs and level of the developer .

---
1. Structuring of Terrafrom configurations
- <mark>main.tf</mark> call modules, locals, and data sources to create all resources
- <mark>variables.tf</mark> contains declarations of variables used in <mark>main.tf</mark>
- <mark>outputs.tf</mark> contains outputs from the resources created in <mark>main.tf</mark>
- <mark>versions.tf</mark> contains version requirements for Terraform and providers
- <mark>terraform.tfvars</mark>  Specify their values in a variable definitions file

2. Structure folder
```
enviroment/
â”œâ”€â”€ develop/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf
|   â”œâ”€â”€ terraform.tfvars
|   â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf
|   â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf
|   â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf
â”œâ”€â”€ stagion/
â”œâ”€â”€ production/
modules/
```

## Naming conventions
1. Use _ (underscore) instead of - (dash) everywhere (in resource names, data source names, variable names, outputs, etc).
2. Use lowercase letters and numbers.

### Resource and data source arguments
1. Do not repeat resource type in resource name (not partially, nor completely)
```
// âœ… Do
`resource "aws_route_table" "public" {}`
```


```
// ðŸš© Don't
`resource "aws_route_table" "public_route_table" {}`
```

```
// ðŸš© Don't
`resource "aws_route_table" "public_aws_route_table" {}`
```

### Variables
- Order keys in a variable block like this: description , type, default
- Always include description on all variables even if you think it is obvious (you will need it in the future).
- Prefer using simple types (number, string, list(...), map(...), any) over specific type like object() unless you need to have strict constraints on each key
- Use type any to disable type validation starting from a certain depth or when multiple types should be supported.


### Outputs
- Good structure for the name of output looks like ```{name}_{type}_{attribute}```
    - ```{name}``` is a resource or data source name without a provider prefix. ```{name}``` for ```aws_subnet``` is ```subnet```, ```foraws_vpc``` it is ```vpc```.
    - ```{type}``` is a type of a resource sources
    - ```{attribute}``` is an attribute returned by the output
- If the output is returning a value with interpolation functions and multiple resources, ```{name}``` and ```{type}```
- Always include description for all outputs even if you think it is obvious.

```
// âœ… Do
output "security_group_id" {
  description = "The ID of the security group"
  value       = aws_security_group.web.id
}
```

```
// ðŸš© Don't
output "this_security_group_id" {
  value       = aws_security_group.web.id
}
```
## Management Terraform State
- Use backend defines to store state data files

### S3 Store state
- Stores the state as a given key in a given bucket on Amazon S3.

```
// âœ… Example
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "mybucket"
    key    = "path/to/my/key"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

```
